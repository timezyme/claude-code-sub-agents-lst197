## 📦 Installation

### Quick Setup

These subagents are automatically available when placed in the `~/.claude/agents/` directory. Claude Code will automatically detect and load them on startup.

```bash
# Clone the repository to your Claude agents directory
# Documents are base on the scaffold from https://github.com/wshobson/agents.git
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/lst97/claude-code-sub-agents.git agents

# Or if the directory already exists, pull the latest updates
cd ~/.claude/agents
git pull origin main
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually copy individual agent files:

```bash
# Copy specific agents to your Claude agents directory
cp /path/to/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Verification

To verify agents are loaded correctly:

```bash
# List all available agents
ls ~/.claude/agents/*.md

# Check Claude Code recognizes the agents (run in Claude Code)
# "List all available subagents"
```

### 🔧 MCP Server Configuration (Required for Full Performance)

To enable optimal performance with specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enhance agent capabilities, add the following configuration to your **global** Claude settings file (`~/.claude.json`):

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
    ],
    "env": {}
  },
  "context7": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@upstash/context7-mcp"
    ],
    "env": {}
  },
  "magic": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@21st-dev/magic@latest",
      "API_KEY=\"api-key\"" // API key is required
    ],
    "env": {}
  },
  "playwright": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@playwright/mcp@latest"
    ],
    "env": {}
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
      "/your/allowed/path" // please add your path here
    ]
  },
  "puppeteer": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "puppeteer-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {}
  }
}
```

**MCP Server Benefits:**

- **sequential-thinking**: Enhanced multi-step reasoning and complex analysis
- **context7**: Access to up-to-date documentation and framework patterns
- **magic**: Advanced UI component generation and design system integration
- **playwright**: Cross-browser testing and E2E automation capabilities

**Note**: These MCP servers significantly enhance agent capabilities but are not strictly required for basic functionality.

### 🎭 Advanced: Agent-Organizer Auto-Dispatch Setup

For complex projects requiring multi-agent coordination, you can enable the dispatch protocol in your **project root directory** (not globally):

```bash
# Copy CLAUDE.md to your PROJECT root directory (recommended)
cp /path/to/agents/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
```

**⚠️ Project-Scope Recommendation:**

- **✅ Project-Specific**: Place CLAUDE.md in individual project roots for targeted orchestration
- **❌ Global Scope**: Avoid placing in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to prevent over-orchestration of simple tasks
- **🎯 Selective Usage**: Enable only for projects requiring comprehensive multi-agent workflows

**Trade-offs to Consider:**

- **Quality vs Speed**: Multi-agent workflows provide expert results but take longer
- **Token Efficiency**: 2-5x token usage for comprehensive analysis and implementation
- **Complexity Matching**: Best for complex projects, may over-engineer simple tasks

## 🔧 Usage

### Automatic Invocation (Recommended)

Claude Code intelligently analyzes your request and automatically delegates to the most appropriate subagent(s) based on:

- **Context Analysis**: Keywords, file types, and project structure
- **Task Classification**: Development, debugging, optimization, etc.
- **Domain Expertise**: Matching requirements to specialist knowledge
- **Workflow Patterns**: Common multi-agent coordination scenarios

**Example**: `"Implement user authentication with secure password handling"` → Automatically uses: `backend-architect` → `security-auditor` → `test-automator`

### Explicit Invocation

For specific expertise or when you want control over agent selection:

```bash
# Direct agent requests
"Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
"Have the security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
"Get the performance-engineer to optimize this bottleneck"

# Multi-agent requests
"Have backend-architect design the API, then security-auditor review it"
"Use data-scientist to analyze this dataset, then ai-engineer to build recommendations"
```

### Hybrid Approach

Combine automatic and explicit invocation:

```bash
# Start explicit, let Claude coordinate the rest
"Use backend-architect to design a REST API for user management, then handle the implementation automatically"

# Explicit validation after automatic work
"Implement this feature automatically, then have security-auditor review the result"
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Direct Agent Invocation

When not using agent-organizer, specify the exact agent needed for your task:

```bash
# Development Tasks
"Use backend-architect to design a REST API for user management"
"Have frontend-developer create a responsive login form component"
"Get python-pro to implement async data processing with proper error handling"
"Have nuxt4-pro optimize this component for performance and add proper TypeScript types"
"Use typescript-pro to refactor this module with advanced type safety"

# Code Quality & Review
"Use code-reviewer to analyze this pull request for best practices"
"Have architect-reviewer check if this change maintains architectural consistency"
"Get debugger to investigate why this test is failing intermittently"

# Security & Performance
"Have security-auditor scan this authentication module for vulnerabilities"
"Use performance-engineer to identify bottlenecks in this API endpoint"
"Get database-optimizer to improve these slow queries"

# Testing & QA
"Use test-automator to create comprehensive tests for this user service"
"Have qa-expert design a testing strategy for this new feature"

# Infrastructure & Deployment
"Get devops-incident-responder to investigate this production deployment failure"
"Use cloud-architect to design scalable infrastructure for this microservice"
"Have deployment-engineer set up CI/CD pipeline for this repository"

# Data & AI
"Use data-scientist to analyze user behavior patterns in this dataset"
"Have ai-engineer implement a RAG system for document search"
"Get ml-engineer to deploy this trained model to production"

# Documentation & Specialization
"Use documentation-expert to create comprehensive API documentation"
"Have api-documenter generate OpenAPI specs for these endpoints"

# Multi-Agent Coordination Examples
"Use backend-architect to design the API, then have security-auditor review it"
"Get frontend-developer to build the component, then use test-automator for coverage"
"Have database-optimizer improve queries, then performance-engineer validate results"
```

### Agent Communication Protocol Examples

Each agent uses a standardized communication protocol with agent-specific context requests. Here are examples:

#### Frontend Development

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "frontend-developer",
  "request_type": "get_task_briefing",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Initial briefing required for UI component development. Provide overview of existing React project structure, design system, component library, and relevant frontend files."
  }
}
```

## 📋 Subagent Format

Each subagent follows a standardized structure for consistent behavior and optimal integration:

### File Structure

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: When this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2  # Optional - defaults to all tools
---

# Subagent Name

**Role**: Detailed role description and primary responsibilities

**Expertise**: Specific technologies, frameworks, and domain knowledge

**Key Capabilities**:
